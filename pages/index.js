            We Believe in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit;
            and that the Bible is the inspired Word of God. We are a friendly,
            warm and welcoming congregation of between 75-85 people each Sunday.
            St. Paul&apos;s is a growing congregation and so excited to see what
            the Lord has planned for each new day! The people of St. Paul&apos;s
            are called to share the love of God. Our choir and our praise group
            provide a unique combination of both contemporary music and
            traditional hymns. Loving people, heartfelt music, and Pastor
            Kim&apos;s positive messages of Christ&apos;s love and our ongoing
            relationship with God combine to create a beautiful worship
            experience. If you will be in the Denver area, please feel free to
            stop by St. Paul&apos;s for Sunday Worship, Sunday School, Bible
            Study, or any of our special events! And if you already live in the
            area, stop by and see what all the excitement is about!

            St. Paul&apos;s Community Church was organized in 1894. It has ties
            to the Evangelical & Reformed and the Congregational and Christian
            churches which became the United Church of Christ in 1957. On
            September 4, 2005, St. Paul&apos;s voted to become an independent,
            nondenominational, Bible-based church. The initial congregation had
            a German heritage and St. Paul&apos;s was once a mission church. In
            the present days, St. Paul&apos;s tries hard to be a church in
            mission to our community and the world. Outreach is very important
            to the people of St. Paul&apos;s. We actively support a wide-range
            of people and programs, including the Jeffco Action Center, the
            Colorado Children&apos;s Home, the Women&apos;s Empowerment program,
            Coats for Colorado, World Vision, Feed the Children, Loving Hugs, a
            children&apos;s hospice and a mission outreach center in Curacao, a
            group of Christmas families, and others. To read more details about
            the outreach we provide, go to our Outreach Page!
